Introduction to Python
======================

This repository contains the material used in the `hands-on` section of the UB master course `Introduction to coding` (February 2023)  

To run the code just clone this repository and then start Jupyter notebook or Jupyter lab on your computer. The notebooks used in the course are in the folder `course/notebooks`.  
Alternatively, if you cannot install Python and Jupyterlab on your computer, you can use a virtual machine running Lubuntu that already included this course.  
To use the virtual machine you need to:
* install [VM VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads/)
* download the [virtual machine](https://drive.bio.idibell.cat/index.php/s/SFexR2arMicTEND)

The slides of the presentation are available [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/11G-e6zB6aOVzAmoM-gPDi8OeR6c5ORPpDQwuWkmzX7M/edit?usp=sharing)
